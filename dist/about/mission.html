				PennyEther's mission is to deliver <b>the next generation of blockchain gaming</b>. We're creating a fully autonous Ethereum gaming platform, owned by Token Holders, and offering the most interactive and exciting games on the Ethereum blockchain. Much more information can be found in <a href="/ico/whitepaper.html">our whitepaper</a>.

				<div class="head">Our Values</div>
				<div class="body">
					<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Fairness</h3>
					<p>
						Our entire platform was built with fairness in mind. All of our games are <b>open sourced</b>, <b>independantly audited</b>, and <b>provably fair</b>.
						<br><br>
						<b>Penny Auctions:</b>
						<ul>
							
							<li>
								Unlike typical Penny Auction websites, there can be no shill bidding. Bids get distributed to all Token Holders, so there's no way anybody can bid and get their money back - not even the owners.
							</li>
							<li>
								The prize is held in the contact and can only be sent to the winner. It's redeemable the moment the auction has ended.
							</li>
							<li>
								Bids are never wasted -- your bid will be refunded if it doesn't result in you becoming the current winner. This includes the following situations:
								<ul>
									<li>You are already the current winner</li>
									<li>The auction ends by the time your bid is mined</li>
									<li>Somebody else bids after you in the same block</li>
									<li>You send the wrong amount</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<b>InstaDice</b>
						<ul>
							<li>We use the blockchain for randomness. No third party or oracles are used.</li>
							<li>Wagers will never be taken unless they can paid on a win.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Transparency</h3>
					<p>
						We're open about our contracts, and everything that goes on in our platform.
						<ul>
							<li><a href="/about/contracts.html">Our contracts</a> are open sourced, tested, and audited</li>
							<li><a href="/games/viewroll.html#1">View results of prior rolls.</a></li>
							<li><a href="/games/viewpennyauction.html">View results of prior auctions.</a></li>
							<li><a href="/status/games.html">View the statuses of our game contracts.</a></li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>User Experience</h3>
					<p>
						We started PennyEther because we were underwhelmed with the state of blockchain gaming. We'll never release a game unless it meets our standards:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>No Signup</b>: Why should you need to provide any information to play?
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Wager in Ether</b>: There's no need to exchange Ether for tokens.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Interactive UI</b>: The UI will show you what's going on every step of the way -- from your transaction being mined, to the results.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Function first, looks second</b>: We'll never sacrifice useful features just to make the UI look cooler. We want to provide our gamers with the information they need to make informed decisions.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Security, Decentralization, and Autonomy</h3>
					<p>
						We don't trust anyone, not even ourselves. We've done our best to make PennyEther decentralized, autonomous, and secure -- for both gamers and token holders.  For more information on this topic, refer to <a href="/ico/whitepaper.html#security">our whitepaper</a>.
