							PennyEther's mission is to deliver <b>the next generation of blockchain gaming</b>. We're creating a fully autonous Ethereum gaming platform, owned by Token Holders, open to developers, and launching with most interactive and exciting games on the Ethereum blockchain.

						PennyEther was designed to give our Token Holders real ownership and a stake in our success, and to <a href="/ico/whitepaper.html#owner-alignment">align the PennyEther Team with investors</a>:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="/about/all-contracts#penny-token">The PENNY Token</a> distributes any Ether received to all Token Holders, proportional to their ownership percentage at the time the Ether is received.
							</li>
							<li>
								The PENNY Token gets 100% of all profits earned by the entire platform, on a continual basis. There are no distribution periods, and owed dividends can be collected at any time, forever.
							</li>
							<li>
								After the ICO, the PennyEther Team will own only 20% of all tokens, which will <a href="/about/all-contracts#dividend-token-locker">vest over a period of 600 days</a>. This incentivizes the team to boost revenues, but also gives our investors the lion's share of profits.
							</li>
							<li>
								We're working hard to get a <a href="/about/all-contracts#dao">DAO contract</a> running that will replace the PennyEther Team's ownership role. This means Token Holders will call the shots by voting to alter all aspects of PennyEther, from game settings to how Capital is allocated across games.
							</li>
							<li>
								We actually <i>require</i> distributed ownership to be able to run <a href="/ico/whitepaper.html#monarchy">Monarchy</a>, the world's only provably fair king-of-the-hill game. Without a diverse base of Token Holders, Monarchy players would not be assured the game is fair.

						We've implemented <a href="/ico/whitepaper.html#security-autonomy">several layers of security</a> to protect all the funds in PennyEther.
						<ul>
							<li>
								We've done our best to thoroughly document, test, and audit all of our contracts. We've made available all contract code, tests, test results, and audit results. <a href="/about/all-contracts.html">Read more here.</a>

							<li>
								<b>The Treasury</b> holds all PennyEther funds. Profits are only ever sent to the DividendToken; this is hard-coded and immutable behavior.  Capital can only be moved via <b>Governance</b> requests, which in the future will be controlled by a DAO. <a href="/about/all-contracts.html#dao">Read more here.</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>The Owner Wallet</b> is a special smart contract that is owned by a cold-storage wallet. A <i>Custodian</i> can make calls on behalf of the owner, but can be changed should it be compromised. This protects the PennyEther system, ensuring that even if the Custodian account is compromised, everything is recoverable. <a href="/about/contracts#owner">Read more here.</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>The Admin Account</b> can change certain configurations of PennyEther, but cannot cause funds to leave the Treasury nor can it deplete funds of Game Contracts. Since this contract is frequently used, it's most likely to be compromised -- but we've severly limited what it can do. <a href="/about/all-contracts.html#roles">Read more here.</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Autonomy</b> ensures investors are never at the whim of the Owners taking action. We actually <i>pay the community</i> to keep our system running - from dispersal of dividends to the restarting of Monarchy games. Dividends should always flow, and games should always run. <a href="/about/all-contracts.html#task-manager">Read more here.</a>

						We started PennyEther because we were underwhelmed with the state of blockchain gaming, and the what it means to hold a Token. We want the PENNY Token to actually mean something, and we want to make it easy to interact with.

								<b>ERC20 DividendToken</b>, <a href="https://medium.com/@weka/dividend-bearing-tokens-on-ethereum-42d01c710657" target="_blank">first posited by Nick Johnson here</a>, was <a href="/about/all-contracts.html#penny-token">fully implemented and tested</a> by us. Quite frankly, we think automated dividends should be the new standard.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Our Test Framework</b>, as best we can tell, allows us to write the most thorough Solidity tests ever. We <a href="/about/all-contracts.html">invite you to take a look for yourself</a>.

							<li>
								<b>Our UI</b> contains countless innovations. From allowing you to choose your gas price, to showing you full annotated details about every transaction, we're creating the dApp we've always wanted to use.
