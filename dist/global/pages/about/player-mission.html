							PennyEther's mission is to deliver <b>the next generation of blockchain gaming</b>. We're creating a fully autonous Ethereum gaming platform, owned by Token Holders, open to developers, and launching with most interactive and exciting games on the Ethereum blockchain.

						All of <a href="/about/game-contracts.html">our game contracts</a> are <b>open sourced</b>, <b>independantly audited</b>, and <b>provably fair</b>. Here are a few other ways we go above and beyond to ensure we're treating our customers right:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Distributed ownership</b> ensures that there's no "insider" that is able to play games for free. All proceeds of all games get distributed to Token Holders.
							</li>
							<li>
								Our games <b>guarantee full payment</b> on any bet. Our contracts will not accept a bet unless they have Ether to back up multiple times the maximum win amount.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>We trust no one but the blockchain</b>. No oracles. No off-chain random number generators.
							</li>
							<li>
								Our games are extremely <b>gas efficient</b>. On top of that, for most errors we'll log an event rather than consume all of the gas of the transaction.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Our UI is resilient</b> against blockchain re-orgs. If your transaction results "change", we'll show you the latest results.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Monarchy Features</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>There can be no cheating.</b> All fees collected get distributed to Token Holders, thus the scenario where the owner can participate for free is <u>eliminated</u>. Monarchy is the world's first provably-fair king-of-the-hill game.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>The prize is held in the contact and can only be sent to the winner</b>. It's redeemable the moment the game has ended. There's nothing in the world, short of Ethereum going down, that can change this behavior.
							</li>
							<li>
								Overthrow fees are never wasted -- your fee will be refunded (and gas saved) if it doesn't result in you becoming the Monarch. This includes the following situations:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Somebody else overthrows <i>you</i> in the same block
									</li>
									<li>
										The games ends before your overthrow is mined
									</li>
									<li>
										You are already the current Monarch
									</li>
									<li>
										You send the wrong amount
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							More information can be found in the <a href="/games/monarchy-faqs.html">Monarchy FAQs</a>.

						<h3>InstaDice Features</h3>
						<ul>

							</li>

							</li>
							<li>

								Extremely low house fee of just 1%
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							More information can be found in the <a href="/games/instadice-faqs.html">InstaDice FAQs</a>.

						We've worked hard to provide a gaming experience that requires essentially zero trust.
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>No deposit is needed.</b> We don't require that you trust us with your funds.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>No account is needed.</b> Simply use your Ethereum wallet from MetaMask. We'll never ask you for any information about yourself.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>No tokens are needed.</b> We don't require that you exchange your Ether for Tokens. Just use your Ether to play!
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>We're entirely on the blockchain.</b> We have no database or any point of failure.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Our UI is open source.</b> Should somebody attempt to DDoS our domain to prevent you from playing, <a href="#">it's quite easy to run the UI on your own computer.</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Our UI contains no 3rd party dependancies.</b> All code in our UI is served locally. There's no way for a 3rd party library to secretly change web3 transaction requests.

					<p>
						We started PennyEther because we were underwhelmed with the state of blockchain gaming, and wanted to create games that we would actually play.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>We'll never release a game unless it meets our standards</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>No Signup</b>: Why should you need to provide any information to play?
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Wager in Ether</b>: There's no need to exchange Ether for tokens.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Interactive UI</b>: The UI will show you what's going on every step of the way -- from your transaction being mined, to the results.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Function first, looks second</b>: We'll never sacrifice useful features just to make the UI look cooler. We want to provide our gamers with the information they need to make informed decisions.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Smart Gas Prices</b>: Every time you create a transaction, we'll show you a slider to help you choose your Gas Price. It uses data generously provided by <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">EthGasStation</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Resilient against blockchain re-orgs</b>: Just because you get a transaction receipt doesn't mean the results are set in stone. Blockchain re-orgs can cause your transaction to have different results entirely. Our UI will always show you the most up-to-date data from your provider, even if it changes.

						We're pretty proud of what we've built, and we're just getting started.
					</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Easily choose your Gas Price</b> before every transaction using data from <a href="https://ethgasstation.info">EthGasStation</a>'s realtime block data.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>See the full details of every transaction</b>. From a mining status bar, to confirmation messages, you'll never be wondering what's going on. The upper-right "status" area shows your account information and any current transactions, including the function names, parameters, and comments.
							</li>
							<li>
								Monarchy is <b>the world's first provably fair king-of-the-hill game</b>, made possible by the <a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/">PENNY Token</a> which distributes realtime dividends.
							</li>
							<li>
								InstaDice is <b>Ethereum's only instant dice game</b>. All other "blockchain dice" games either take twice as long (and cost more gas), or are not actually based on the blockchain at all.
							</li>
							<li>
								VideoPoker is the world's first <b>Video Poker smart contract</b>. All other "blockchain poker" games are not actually smart contracts and do guarantee payout.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Blockchain Resilience</b> ensures you'll also see the most up-to-date information about the state of your games. In case there's a blockchain re-org, we've got you covered -- any games that may be affected by this, <a href="/games/videopoker-faqs.html#blockchain-reorg">like VideoPoker</a>, will double-check to ensure you don't accidentally submit a transaction against an unexpected game state.
