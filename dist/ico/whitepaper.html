								PennyEther is an Ethereum-based distributed application that autonomously runs any number of revenue generating smart contracts. PennyEther is <a href="/status/overview.html" target="_blank">already deployed</a>, thoroughly tested, and currently runs three innovative games that are best-in-breed, and profitable: <a href="/games/monarchy.html" target="_blank">Monarchy</a>, <a href="/games/instadice.html" target="_blank">InstaDice</a>, and <a href="/games/videopoker.html">Video Poker</a>. All of our games meet <a href="#game-standards">our high standards</a>, and <a href="/about/contracts.html" target="_blank">all contracts</a> are open-source, well-documented, thoroughly tested, and are undergoing audit.
							</p>
							<p>
								PennyEther runs on top of <a href="#transparency">transparent</a> <a href="#application">Core</a> that is <a href="#scalability">scalable</a>, <a href="#security">secure</a>, and that <a href="#token-contract">distributes 100% of profits</a> to Token Holders. We've created an <a href="/about/overview.html" target="_blank">interactive overview</a> that shows how <a href="#the-application">the application</a> works. We also have the technology in place to allow <a href="#games-3rd-party">3rd Party Developers</a> to run games on our platform and share in profits.
							</p>
							<p>
								We strongly believe we've created the world's most sophisticated autonomous blockchain application, and are excited to sell 80% ownership to the public. We're having an ICO for four reasons:
								<ol>
									<li>
										Distributing ownership is a value-add to our customers, as it insures there can be no shill bidding in our flagship <a href="#monarchy">Monarchy</a> game. Customers can be sure there is no insider that can participate for free since all revenue gets distributed to token holders.
									</li>
									<li>
										Our <a href="https://github.com/pennyether/ui" target="_blank">UI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pennyether/contracts" target="_blank">contracts</a> are open-sourced. By distributing ownership, we provide a financial incentive for developers to contribute to the project.
									</li>
									<li>
										By obtaining bankroll, we bankroll current and future games, allowing them to safely accept higher wagers, and thus, receive more revenue.
									</li>
									<li>
										By obtaining cash, we can focus on dominating the <a href="#the-market">Ethereum gambling market</a> by further branding, designing, marketing, advertising, and developing.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
								Ethereum's features of decentralization, smart contracts, fast block times, tokenization, and privacy are not merely buzzwords -- but <a href="#perfect-for-ethereum">all contribute</a> towards an <b>autonomous</b>, <b>fair</b>, <b>trustless</b>, and <b>profitable</b> distributed application.
							</p>
							<p>
								We feel it is important to note that while <a href="#pennyether-team">our team</a> is anonymous</a>, we're not a typical ICO selling promises; <b>we've already delivered</b>, are taking bets now, and have <a href="#roadmap-future">a lot more planned</a>. We invite you to explore what we've created, to compare it to <a href="#competitive-landscape">our competition</a>, to view <a href="https://github.com/pennyether" target="_blank">our source code</a>, and to learn a lot more in this document.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lastly, we recommend you read the brief <a href="/ico/intro.html" target="_blank">introduction</a>, and to walk through the <a href="/about/overview.html">interactive system overview</a> to understand how the platform works.
							</p>
							<p>
								As always, we would love to hear from you. We can be contacted via these channels:
								<ul>

							<div class="head">Mission Statement</div>
							<div class="body">
								<p>
									Over a year ago, our team became interested in blockchain applications, and began brainstorming ways in which the blockchain could actually add value to existing business models, and not merely piggy back off of the hype. We viewed <a href="www.ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>, in particular, as an amazing blockchain -- everything about a traditional blockchain (privacy, transparency, security, etc), but with smart contracts, fast block times, amazing core developers, the ability to distribute ownership via tokens, and tools to easily connect it to the web.
								</p>
								<p>
									We realized the potential of programmable money and we wanted to use all of the features of Ethereum to create something entirely new, exciting, and innovative. What we initially settled on were "Penny Auctions" -- a vastly more compelling type of game than what was currently offered, with a sizable existing market and tremendous popularity. This would become the game we call <a href="#monarch">Monarchy</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									We soon realized some of our core features of autonomy and distributed ownership could unlock more fairness for gamers, and more value for token holders.
								</p>
								<p>
									Firstly, <i>distributing ownership</i> can make some types of games actually fair. Penny Auctions, also known as <a href="#monarch">Monarchy</a> are a prime example. Despite their popularity, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidding_fee_auction#Criticism" target="_blank">common criticism</a> of Penny Auctions is that the websites that run them can secretly run their own "bid bots" to ensure the house always wins. With distributed ownership, this is made impossible because all bid fees are distributed to token holders. All types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pay_auction" target="_blank">"all-pay auctions"</a>, such as lotteries and raffles, are made fair in the same manner.
								</p>
								<p>
									Secondly, we've had a long look at <a href="#competitive-landscape">the competition</a>. While there are many innovative ideas in progress (such as FunFair's Fate Channels), <b>we are severely underwhelmed by what is actually available for both gamers and investors</b>. The games do not <a href="#game-standards">meet our standards</a>, the user experience is awful, the dividends (if any) are issued at the owner's whim and freeze the token. There is no autonomy -- owners are ultimately running the show with no guarantees to the token holders. <b>We knew we could do better.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>This brings us to our mission.</b>
									<br><br>
									We are focused on delivering a blockchain application that:
									<ul>
										<li>profits from compelling, fun, and fair games that meet <a href="#game-standards">our standards</a></li>
										<li>pays 100% of profits as <a href="#token-contract">dividends on-demand</a></li>
										<li><a href="#security-autonomy">runs itself</a>, and is <a href="/status/overview.html" target="_blank">transparent about everything</a></li>
										<li><a href="#security">is secure for token holders</a>: it limits the worst-case scenario of owner malevolence</li>
										<li>utilizes Ethereum <a href="#perfect-for-ethereum">to its fullest</a></li>
										<li>adopts new technologies as they become available</li>
										<li>can <a href="#scalability">easily add new sources</a> of revenue</li>
										<li>in the long run, <a href="#roadmap-future">will run traditional casino games</a></li>
									</ul>

							<div class="head">The Team</div>
							<div class="body">
								<p>
									We're a small group of programmers and technology enthusiasts that are unafraid to push the limits of blockchain technology. We have our sights set on creating the world's first truly autonomous organization.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Our team will remain anonymous for the foreseeable future. We realize the skepticism surrounding anonymous ICOs, and we want to address it directly.</b>
								</p>

								<h3>Foreword</h3>
								<p>
									Firstly, we'd like to note that we've done <i>everything</i> possible to make our anonymity practically irrelevant. To date:
									<ul>
										<li>
											We're not raising funds on promises. We've already coded, open-sourced, deployed, and tested the Core product as well three best-in-breed games.
										</li>
										<li>
											Our interests are <a href="#owner-alignment">fully aligned with our investors</a>. We maintain 20% ownership, and thus are committed to growing revenues and increasing the value of PENNY Token. Furthermore, without a provably distributed ownership, our flagship game Monarchy would not generate revenue.
										</li>
										<li>
											Our <a href="/about/contracts.html" target="_blank">contracts</a> are well-documented, open-sourced, and in the process of being audited. For the Core contracts, there are no backdoors and no ways to "turn them off".
										</li>
										<li>
											We're transparent about our entire system. You can view the <a href="/status/overview.html" target="_blank">financial status and configuration</a> of PennyEther at any time. Funds are controlled via <a href="#governance">Governance</a>, which provides transparency and allows us to hand off control to a DAO in the future.
										</li>
										<li>
											We're keeping 20% ownership of the application, and as such are deeply incentivized to increase its profits, and token value. We would be harming ourselves by abandoning the project.
										</li>
										<li>
											We've invested significantly in <a href="#scalability">infrastructure</a>. These investments were for longterm growth, and would otherwise be unnecessary.
										</li>
										<li>
											Our whitepaper is not a marketing document. It's intended to provide you with all of the information necessary to make an educated decision.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>Why Anonymous?</h3>
								<p>
									We're remaining anonymous for three reasons:
									<ol>
										<li>Decentralization, and true autonomy.</li>
										<li>The complicated international regulations of online gaming.</li>
										<li>The complicated international regulations of blockchain tokenization.</li>
									</ol>

									<h4>1: Decentralization and True Autonomy</h4>
									<p>
										Truth be told, we're much more interested in technology than we are about legal frameworks and regulations. Part of <a href="#mission">our mission</a> is to create a <i>truly</i> decentralized, censorship-free application. This is, in fact, a key reason we chose gaming -- it's all on the blockchain.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>If the goal is to create a distributed and autonomous application that cannot ever be shut down or censored, then the ability to obtain the private keys which could harm it should be limited as much as possible.</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										Unfortunately, the weakest link in the decentralization of PennyEther is us, the owners. Even though our team <i>knows</i> being anonymous is not good for an ICO, we're doing it anyway because we know it makes PennyEther more censorship resistant and secure.
									</p>

									<h4>2: Online Gambling</h4>
									<p>
										PennyEther's target market is international.
										<br><br>
										<i>Not</i> being anonymous would:
										<ul>
											<li>Require development time and legal resources to abide by <i>every</i> region's own rules and regulations.</li>
											<li>Expose the team to personal liability from virtually everywhere in the world.</li>
										</ul>
										Being anonymous:
										<ul>
											<li>Allows us to focus strictly on the technology.</li>
											<li>Allows anyone in the world to participate.</li>
											<li>Aligns with our ethos of "it's your Ether, do what you want"</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<h4>3: Tokenization and ICOs</h4>
									<p>
										As with the above, we're not interested in every specific region's rules and regulations regarding ICOs. We feel confident that this no-frills whitepaper, our open sourced code, and all of our other materials provide <i>you</i> with the information <i>you</i> need to make an informed decision about whether or not <i>you</i> want to invest <i>your</i> Ether into this project.
									</p>
									<p>
										With respect to current or retroactive regulations regarding ICOs, in whatever regions may or may not be applicable -- we want to limit our personal liabilities as much as possible.
									</p>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="owner-alignment"></a>
								<h3>Alignment of Goals</h3>
								<p>
									While there are many safeguards in place that ensure transparency, prior to the instatement of <a href="#the-dao">the DAO</a> the PennyEther Team will <i>technically</i> have full control over PennyEther. However, <i>there is no incentive to act maliciously</i>, as the team's goals are purely aligned with Token Holders:
									<ul>
										<li>
											The PennyEther Team will initially own 20% of PENNY Tokens. This means there is a strong incentive to increase profit flow and to raise the value of PENNY Tokens. Any actions that counter this would be to the detriment of the PennyEther Team. 
										</li>
										<li>
											It is very likely that the value of PENNY Tokens will outweigh any short-term incentive of pilfering Capital or profits. That is, the "gain" of stealing Capital or profits will not outweigh the "loss" incurred from a plummeting Token value. Furthermore, presumably PennyEther will produce profits. If this is the case, there is very little incentive to steal funds which would otherwise return to the PennyEther Team in the form of dividends.
										</li>
										<li>
											Should the PennyEther Team attempt to syphon profits away from the Treasury, the <a href="#monarchy">Monarchy</a> game will no longer be provably fair -- that is, the PennyEther Team would be able to <a href="#penny-auction-problems">shill bid</a>. This would likely cause nobody to play Monarchy anymore, dramatically decreasing profits and the value of PENNY Tokens.
										</li>
										<li>
											Should the PennyEther Team attempt to steal Treasury bankroll (by, for example, allocating Bankroll to a malicious contract), a dramatic loss of trust would occur, and the value of PENNY Tokens would plummet. Furthermore, it would become impossible to raise additional capital to fund any new games.
										</li>
										<li>
											Since PennyEther is open-sourced, there exists a strong incentive for the PennyEther Team to consistently deliver new games and manage PennyEther properly. Should the PennyEther Team fail to do so, there exists a chance that PennyEther is cloned and that profits and Token value will drop due to a competitor's existance.
										</li>
										<li>
											Although the team is anonymous, there still exists a strong incentive to do right by investors. Defrauding investors would place the personal freedom of the PennyEther Team at risk due to possible investigations and strong incentives to "dox".
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										It should be noted that the above concerns are only temporary.  <b>Once the DAO is instated, PennyEther will fully in the hands of Token Holders</b>, though with 20% ownership the PennyEther Team will still be incentivized to contribute to PennyEther.
									</p>
								</p>

								<h3>About Trust</h3>
								<p>
									At the end of the day, it's your decision whether or not you want to trust any team. If LinkedIn profiles, hyped up projects, and fancy landing pages are your type of thing, we understand and respect that, and it's your choice not to participate. If, on the other hand, you value the most comprehensive working dApp that's already deployed, tested, and undergoing audits, you should read on.

							<div class="head">Our Standards</div>
							<div class="body">
								<p>
									We think the greatest challenge in blockchain gaming is adoption. While this will grow over time, there are things we can do <i>right now</i> to maximize the amount of players, and the amount they play. We also believe that quality and usability are crucial.
								</p>
								<b>We will never release a game unless it meets these criteria:</b>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Zero Friction</b>: Eliminate all steps it takes a user to actually play.
										<ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
											<li>
												<b>No Signup</b>: Why should a user need to provide any information to play?
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Wager in Ether</b>: Requiring the use of tokens requires the user spend a significant amount of time and effort interacting with exchanges. There are considerable security, privacy, volatility, and liquidity risks involved.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Help users get Ether</b>: If a user doesn't have a web3 browser, we tell them how to get one. If they don't have Ether, we tell them how to get some.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Instant Results</b>: We want to show users their results as soon as their interaction is mined. Whether it's a roll, drawing cards, or overthrowing the Monarch.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A Comprehensive UI</b>: We'd rather have an extremely usable and trustworthy UI than one that looks really cool. While we try to do both, our top UI priority is presenting the user with <i>all the information they need</i>, and feedback about <i>every step</i> of their transaction -- from chosing a gas price to seeing the results.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Assure the User</b>: Provide the users with as much as possible to prove the game is legitimate. Previous wagers, contract code, audit results, test results, etc.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>The game is fun, and fair!</b>

							<div class="head">Penny Auctions (aka, Monarchy)</div>
							<div class="body">
								<p>
									We are extremely excited to offer the world's first truly fair Penny Auctions, in the form of our game "Monarchy". Ethereum solves the two existing problems with Penny Auctions: Shill bidding, and prize redemption. With the invention of blockchain and tokenization, there's now a way to protect against shill bidding. Furthermore, prize redemptions is guaranteed via the smart contract.
								</p>
								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>
									A penny auction is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pay_auction" target="_blank">all-pay auction</a> in which a prize is staked by the house, and any participant can pay a small non-refundable fee, much less than the prize, in order to "bid".  When a bid occurs, the auction timer is reset to some amount, and that bidder becomes the current winner.  Once the auction timer expires (due to nobody else bidding), the current winner has won and can claim the prize.  Ideally, the auction receives enough bids so that the house recoups the cost of staked prize.
								</p>
								<div style="background: rgba(0,0,0,.1); padding: 10px; border-radius: 3px;">
									The terms <i>Penny Auction</i> and <i>Monarchy</i> will be used interchangeably. We've branded "penny auctions" as "Monarchy" to make the game much easier to understand, and to add an element of gameplay. The game can be described in a more understandable manner:
									<div style="padding: 10px; font-style: italic; background: white; margin: 10px;">
										The Monarch will win the prize if they reign for long enough without being overthrown. It costs a small fee to overthrow the Monarch and start your reign as the Monarch.
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>
									<b>We've added two dynamics to Penny Auctions to improve gameplay</b>:
									<ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
										<li> Upon each "overthrow", a portion of that fee can be allocated to (or removed from) the prize. This means prizes can continue to grow (or shrink) as the game progresses. We're determining through trial and error how this setting effects gameplay.</li>
										<li>Upon each "overthrow", the user can provide a "decree" in the form of a string. This message will be viewable to all players.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>Prior Art</h3>
								<p>
									The penny auction game format already exists online, and is popular because:
									<ul>
										<li>there is a chance of winning a large prize for a small fee</li>
										<li>it's fast, easy, and cheap to play</li>
										<li>after overthrowing, you are the current winner and can enjoy the anticipation of the timer counting down</li>
										<li>there is action and suspense, such as overthrows coming in and the timer getting very low</li>
										<li>there is strategy involved -- a player can intimidate or try to snipe a game</li>
										<li>somebody is going to win</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>Comparison to Dice</h3>
								<p>
									Monarchy is lot more fun and engaging than simple dice games, and we believe this will attract a lot of users who already game on the blockchain.

								<h3>Problems With Existing Penny Auctions</h3>
								<p>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidding_fee_auction" target="_blank">Penny Auctions</a> are not new. They exploded in popularity a few years ago -- you may have seen commercials for quibids, beezids, etc. They have since faced some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidding_fee_auction#Criticism" target="_blank">controversy and skepticism</a> for two main reasons:
									<ol>
										<li>
											<b>Cheating.</b>  Penny auction websites can cheat, and there is no way of knowing. They can (and have) created bots that bid on their own auctions for free, ensuring they house can never lose. This is called "shill bidding" or "bid botting".
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Failing to Deliver.</b> Penny auction websites have been accused of failing to deliver prizes, or not delivering in a timely manner.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<h3>How PennyEther Fixes This</h3>
								<p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											<b>Preventing Shill Bidding</b>
											<br>
											When an overthrow occurs, the Ether paid will only ever end up in the hands of the token holders. The only way an insider can overthrow for free is if they own 50% or more of all tokens, which given our ICO conditions, would be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, even if this user were to own 50% and did cheat, the blockchain is public; they would have to go through great lengths to constantly wash their coins to make it unknown. Lastly, they would only be discouraging gamers from playing, and would have invested quite a large amount of Ether only to scare away players. <b>For the first time in history, this type of game can occur fairly.</b>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Instant Delivery</b>
											<br>
											In our penny auctions, the prize is held in the smart contract before the game even starts. The only way this Ether leaves the contract is to pay the winner. There's nothing we as owners, or anybody, can do to stop this from happening, short of an attack on the entire Ethereum network. Only the winner will receive the prize, and they will be able to obtain it the instant the game completes.
										</li>

								<h3>Perfect for Ethereum</h3>
								<p>
									We're very bullish about Ethereum, and see it as the perfect platform for Penny Auctions. There is a perfect alignment between Ethereum's feature set and Penny Auctions:
									<ul>
										<li><b>Smart Contracts</b> ensure games' rules are publicly known.</li>
										<li><b>Decentralization</b> ensures games adhere exactly to rules.</li>
										<li><b>Fast Blocktimes</b> ensure bids get submitted quickly and that games are fast paced.</li>
										<li><b>Events / Logs</b> allow the UI to show action as it happens.</li>
										<li><b>Tokenization</b> allows ownership to be distributed, ensuring shill bidding is impossible.</li>
										<li><b>Privacy / Anonymity</b> allows users to participate without having to create an account.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<a data-anchor="games-instadice"></a>
						<div class="page-subsection">
							<div class="head">InstaDice</div>
							<div class="body">
								<p>
									Dice games are an extremely popular form of blockchain gaming in which a user wagers some amount, and has a chance of winning or losing based on a random number. It is essentially roulette, but with a much simpler form of wagering: Simply choose your odds of winning, bet, and see if you've won.
								</p>
								<p>
									We chose to create a Dice game for these reasons:
									<ul>
										<li>To dominate one market. <b>We strongly believe we've created the best blockchain Dice game in existence</b>, and that we'll capture a large percentage of the blockchain dice market.</li>
										<li><b>Instant Results</b> is a key differentiator. The difference in experience between waiting 30 seconds instead of up to 20 minutes is huge.</li>
										<li>InstaDice will attract a large amount of our <a href="#target-market">target market</a> to PennyEther, where they will start playing our other games.</li>
										<li>To ensure our framework makes it easy to add new games -- and it does. InstaDice took about three weeks of development, most of it being the UI.</li>
										<li>We could do better than what existed, in terms of wait-time, transaction cost, and UI.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>Problems with the Competition</h3>
								<p>
									While surveying the competition's dice games, we noticed they all suffer from <b>tremendous lag time</b>, <b>have high minimum wagers</b>, and <b>require a lot of gas</b> to run.
									<br><br>This is due to the way they work:
									<ul>
										<li>Initial transaction (with no suggestion of which Gas Price to use)</li>
										<li>3rd-party Oracle sees a request</li>
										<li>Oracle generates random number</li>
										<li>Oracle creates transaction (fixed 20GWei gas price, often <i>very</i> slow)</li>
										<li>User finally gets result</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									It takes two Ethereum transactions, one of which has a low gas price (meaning it can take a <i>very</i> long time), and all the while the user is left waiting with hardly any indication by the UI. We noticed that in the forums and in chat rooms of our competitors, there were constantly questions about "how long should it take?" and "did I win or lose?".
								</p>
								<p>
									Our competitors use an Oracle to resolve their rolls, which responds via a transactions at a fixed gas price of 20 GWei. During times of congestion can take upwards of 20 minutes.
								</p>
								<b>Large Minimum Bet, Lower House Profit</b>
								<p>
									Because our competitors pay an Oracle for results on each roll, they must enforce a higher maximum bet to ensure they make a profit. Without setting a minimum bet, rolls would cost the house more than they could win.  <b>PennyEther is free to allow any minimum bet because there is no Oracle to pay. Additionally, PennyEther's profit margins are higher.</b>
								</p>

								<h3>Instant Results</h3>
								<p>
									We've created the first dice game to show results the moment the wager is mined, by using the resultant blockhash. While in some cases it is not advisible to use blockhash to generate random numbers, in our case. By limiting the maximum wager size to .375 Ether, we are assured that there is no financial incentive for miners to try to cheat our game.
								</p>
								<p>
									To understand why .375 is a safe amount, we must understand how Dice games can be manipulated by miners. Let's take a simple example where a roll will win double, half of the time. A miner can mine a block, with their own very large wager in it (say, 10 Ether), and view the wager results before submitting the block for confirmation. They can then do one of two things:
									<ol>
										<li>
											If they've won (half the time), submit their block for confirmation. They win the wager, and get a 3 Ether block reward - for a total of 13 Ether.
										</li>
										<li>
											If they haven't won (half the time), submit their block as an uncle and only get an uncle reward of 2.625 Ether. They could also try to mine the block again, but are very unlikely to win the block in time.
										</li>
									</ol>
									From the above, with an unrestricted bet size, the expected payout is <span class="code">(3 + 10)/2 + 2.625/2 = 7.8 Ether</span>.  This is well over what the miner would get by mining honestly: <span class="code">3 Ether</span>.
									<br><br>But, <b>with a restricted bet size</b>, the expected payout is <span class="code">(3 + <i>.375</i>)/2 + 2.625/2 = 3 Ether</span>.  <b>By restricting the bet size, miners are <i>not</i> better off trying to cheat.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Note: In the above calculations, we omit factoring in the percentage of the hash power the miner owns. As this percentage grows, the actual maximum bet needs to be lowered. In practice, our maximum bet size will be .5 Ether to account for this.</i>
								</p>

								<h3>A Note About Bet Size</h3>
								<p>
									The recent rise in the price of Ethereum has made the maximum bet of .375 Ether (~$300 at time of writing) work in PennyEther's favor. We think $300 is a reasonable limit, and is a trade-off we make in order to show results instantly and without an Oracle.
								</p>

								<h3>A Better User Experience</h3>
								<p>
									We invite you to try <a href="#competition">our competitor's</a> games and to see for yourself how the user experience is. The sites are slow, confusing, and provide very little indication of what is going on.
								</p>
								<p>
									Part of <a href="#mission">our mission</a> is to offer the best gaming experience possible. We're always looking for ways to improve our UX, and we've even made our UI open source to allow for others to improve it.
								</p>
								<p>
									We focused on providing the best user experience by adding the following features:
									<ol>
										<li>
											<b>Wager Selector:</b> Our UI allows wagers to easily be chosen and understood. Much like Etheroll, a user can choose their own odds. Unlike Etheroll, our sliders actually work and use sensible values.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Gas Price Slider:</b> Upon wagering, users can choose their gas price using our slider which shows how long a transaction will take to mine, using real-time data from <a href="www.ethgasstation.org" target="_blank">Eth Gas Station</a>.  We haven't seen this feature in <i>any</i> other Ethereum site to date.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Instant Feedback:</b> Our UI shows what is happening every step of the way - from signing the transaction, to it mining, to the final result.  We provide immediate links to <a href="www.etherscan.io" target="_blank">Etherscan</a> so users can view their rolls on the blockchain.  And, we provide a way to see <a href="/games/viewroll#1" target="_blank">the full roll history</a> should any questions arise.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Low Gas Cost:</b> Our dice games offers the lowest gas cost (typically ~50,000 gas)
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Automatic Payout:</b> Bettors will automatically be paid winnings the next time anybody bids. They can, of course, claim their winnings manually if they want.
											<div style="padding: 10px; font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;">Note: There is one rare exception to this case. If two bids occur in the same block, the user must manually claim their winnings. We plan on having a background process automatically catch this and payout the roll.</div>
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="pennyether-vs-other-dice"></a>
								<h3>InstaDice vs The Competition</h3>
								<p>
								We <i>strongly</i> believe we offer a far more compelling dice game than both the Ethereum and Bitcoin competition, and expect to capture a very large percentage of the market. Our one downside is the limited wager of .375 Ether, but we feel this is probably large enough to accomodate the majority of users.

									Late in the process of building PennyEther, we decided to try coding a multi-stage game, and to see if card games were feasible. It turns out that they are, and the gas cost is not too bad. <a href="/games/videopoker.html" target="_blank">Video Poker</a> is our first step towards offering a variety of traditional casino machine games. The game fully meets <a href="#game-standards">our standards</a>.
								</p>
								<b>Here are some of the Features of Video Poker:</b>

									<li><b>Fully on blockchain</b>. No backend server or Oracles are used.</li>
									<li><b>Instant results</b>. The player sees hand results immediately after each transaction.</li>
									<li><b>Low Gas Costs</b>. A full game can be played for about 100,000 gas, which at the time of writing is about 7 cents.</li>
									<li><b>Friendly UI</b>. The UI shows all pending hands, even if the window is closed and re-opened. Players do not need to worry about hands being "lost".</li>
									<li><b>Protection against block re-orgs.</b> The UI may display one hand, but a blockchain re-org may cause the actual on-chain hand to be different.

									Thanks to our investment in <a href="#scalability">scalability</a>, adding games is a relatively simple and straight-forward process.

								</p>
								<p>
									While we don't want to reveal the precise details of the games we're going to develop next, we would like to share some possibilities:

											<b>Paramutuel Betting</b>: A system that allows paramutuel betting on any number of Oraclized things, such as sporting events, election outcomes, cryptocurrency data, etc.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Paramutuel Betting (User Generated)</b>: A system for users to create their own paramutuel betting pool. For example, a user may create a "Bitcoin > $10,000 by Jan 1 2019" bet.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>RNG Games</b>: Some options are plinko, money wheel, and clones of popular offchain bitcoin games like "bustabit", "bitkong", etc.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Global Lottery</b>: A simple lottery game in which a user can pick several numbers. Every two days, a drawing is held. Most of the ticket fees go back into the JackPot, and PennyEther keeps a small fee.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>InstaRoulette</b>: Like InstaDice, but with an entire Roulette wheel available.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>All-Fee Auctions</b>: All-fee auctions are the type of auction made fair by distributed ownership. We're working on a few ideas.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Casino Games</b>: This is our long-term goal. Traditional casino games are currently not viable purely on the blockchain. However, we may explore using a back-end process and using State Channels or new technologies as they progress.

							<div class="head">Third Party Games</div>
							<div class="body">
								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>
									We anticipate that PennyEther will become a compelling platform for developers to create games, and we're open to assisting and running third party games. There are several reason why a developer may choose to create a game and run it on PennyEther rather than on their own:
									<ul>
										<li><b>Access to Bankroll:</b> Should the game pass audits, we'll bankroll the game. For developers, this options is a lot easier and quicker than holding an ICO.</li>
										<li><b>Access to Audience:</b> Should the game meet <a href="#standards">our standards</a>, we'll include it in our UI. This immediately exposes the game to a wide audience of users. From the developers perspective, it's likely their profits would be a smaller slice of a bigger pie.</li>
										<li><b>Ease of Development:</b> Implementing a game contract is as easy as extending one Solidity contract. If the game's UI targets PennyEther, the developer can leverage a wide array of UI components that make development orders of magnitude quicker.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h3>Technology</h3>
								<p>
									Over the course of developing three games, we've made it easy on ourselves by creating simple components to reuse. By offering these tools our developers, we believe the barrier to game development will be lower than ever before. See also: <a href="#scalability">Scalability</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>Contract Development</h4>
									Creating a smart contract to run on PennyEther is as simple as extending one simple contract called <span class="code">Bankrollable</span>. By extending this contract, the following features are implemented for free:
									<ul>
										<li>Treasury can bankroll (and un-bankroll) the Game</li>
										<li>Profits can autonomously be sent to the Treasury</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>User Interface Development</h4>
									Extending our UI grants the developer use of these UI components:
									<ul>
										<li><b>GasSlider Buttons:</b> A widget that allows the user to conveniently select a GasPrice from a range of options provided by EthGasStation</li>
										<li><b>Wager Slider:</b> A widget that allows the user to conveniently select a wager amount, bounding by a minimum and maximum.</li>
										<li><b>Transaction Status Display:</b> A widget that shows the user every step of a transaction, and allows the developer to react to events and customize messages.</li>
										<li><b>Log Viewer:</b> A widget that allows the user to browse past events of a contract, or of their own activity. Extremely simple for the developer to customize this.</li>
										<li><b>NiceWeb3</b>: A wrapper of web3 that makes creating and responding to transactions less bug-prone, and much easier to manage.</li>

									This is a qualitative assessment of our target market, and not a numerical rundown of online gambling or blockchain gambling. This is for a few reasons:
									<ol>
										<li>
											<b>You should do your own research.</b> We do not wish to speculate on what PennyEther will earn. The gambling market is multiple billions of dollars, but it's also quite nuanced. It's ultimately up to you to assess our product, competitors, roadmap, and goals, and determine what the potential is.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Data on blockchain gambling is vast, and volatile.</b> There are hundreds of Bitcoin casinos and a handful of Ethereum casinos -- there's simply too much data to run through, and the volatility of crypto makes it difficult to assign a fiat value. For example, 10,000 Ether of profits a year ago is vastly different than 10,000 Ether or profits today.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Data for Penny Auction websites are kept private.</b>  Estimates range from $40m-$100m+ in annual revenues for one site, but we can't know. The best we can do is Google for articles on these sites, the same as you.

							<div class="head">Market Segments</div>
							<div class="body">
								We see our revenues coming from four segments of customers, each much larger in size, but requiring more time to convert.
								<a data-anchor="first-market-segment"></a>
								<h3>
									Segment One: Existing blockchain gamers
								</h3>
								<p>
									This sizable market includes gamers looking for games that are:
									<ul>
										<li>Provably fair and uncheatable</li>
										<li>Require no sign-up or registration</li>
										<li>Varied in risk/reward and skill</li>
										<li>Focused on ease of use and user experience</li>
										<li>Fast and fun!</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									We strongly feel this segment will easily be converted to use PennyEther. Firstly, <a href="/games/pennyauctions.html" target="_blank">Penny Auctions</a> are not available on any other blockchain site. Secondly, <a href="/games/instadice.html" target="_blank">InstaDice</a> is much more compelling than existing dice games; we expect to see a large percentage of gamers migrating to us. Lastly, this market segment is easily reachable via advertising, marketing, and word of mouth.
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="second-market-segment"></a>
								<h3>Segment Two: Ethereum holders</h3>
								<p>
									This market segment represents the growing set of users who already hold Ethereum (or will in the future), but who have not yet starting using it for gaming.
								</p>
								<p>
									This segment is tied to the natural exponential growth of Ethereum itself. The more Ethereum users there are, the more potential gamers there are. As long as we offer compelling games and a great user experience, we should capture this market.
									<br><br>
									We strongly believe all aspects of Ethereum will grow in our favor:
									<ul>
										<li>The number of users</li>
										<li>The ease of use</li>
										<li>The comfort in using it for transactions</li>
									</ul>
									We're very optimistic about both about the growth of this segment, and their willingness to start using Ethereum for gaming. Through a UI focused on user experience, we believe we will tap into this market rapidly.
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="third-market-segment"></a>
								<h3>Segment Three: Penny Auction Gamers</h3>
								<p>
									This segment represents people that participate (or have participated) in existing Penny Auction websites, and are willing to switch to Ethereum to game. <a href="#pennyether-vs-penny-auction-websites">We believe we offer a compelling value-add to this segment:</a> No sign-up, provable fair and uncheatable, instant prize payment.
									<br><br>
									The challenge with this market is converting them to use Ethereum. While our initial focus will be on segments one and two, after the ICO we will aggressively work towards making the adoption of Ethereum easy for this segment. This includes writing guides, tutorials, videos, etc, all showcasing how easy it is to get and use Ethereum.
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="fourth-market-segment"></a>
								<h3>Segment Four: Online casino gamblers</h3>
								<p>
									This is a much longer term goal, and requires usage of crypto to grow, as well as technology enabling fast and trusthworthy off-chain random number generation (such as State Channels) so that we can add casino games. It's also the hardest segment to capture.
								</p>
								<p>
									There already exist online casinos in which you can deposit crypto into your account and "verify", in some sense, the randomness of the house. It is anyone's guess how valuable "provable fairness" and "smart contracts" will be to this market segment, but <i>we're assuming that all other things being equal, players would rather play in a fully "provably fair" environment</i>, and thus see an advantage.
								</p>
								<p>
									We anticipate current online casinos to transition towards the blockchain in some manner, and given their current capital and player base, are not expecting to be capture the majority of this segment.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, <b>we see this segment arriving from two directions</b> - those coming from online casino gambling, and <i>those coming from crypto casino gambling</i>. We are aiming to capture a large share of the latter, and a lesser share of the former. That is, anyone already preferring to play "pure" blockchain games would ideally use PennyEther to play BlackJack, if and when we release that game. While those already playing in "off-blockchain" online casinos are likely to stay with their casino-of-choice that implements blockchain gaming (if blockchain gaming becomes an important consideration for that user).
								</p>
								<p>
									There is one (unlikely) possibility that online casinos drop the ball entirely and do not pursue creating blockchain games, and that blockchain gaming becomes preferable to their current users. In this case, we consider this a massive opportunity, but are not at all counting on it.
								</p>

							<div class="head">Strategy</div>

								<p>
									<b>Our number one priority is to capture the <a href="#first-market-segment">first</a>, <a href="#second-market-segment">second</a>, and <a href="#third-market-segment">third</a> market segments.</b> We see these as low-hanging fruit, and strongly believe that combined they represent a massive opportunity. Strategically, this will put us in prime position to capture some of the <a href="#fourth-market-segment">fourth</a> segment.
								</p>
								<p>
									After the ICO, we're going to be aggressively trying to increase our brand and player-base by:
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Targeting the Global Market</b>: We know Penny Auctions are huge in other countries such as China. We're going to create translated UIs, and spend marketing dollars to spread the word.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Redesigning our site</b>: Our current UI is focused on functionality as opposed to converting the most amount of viewers to players. We believe it can be vastly improved to provide a more fun and exciting feel, resulting in more revenue.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Advertising</b>: Onling gaming as a whole is a competitive market, but blockchain gaming is a manageable niche. We feel we'll see a positive RoI by targeting existing blockchain gamers in various niche communities.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Recruiting Evangelists</b>: We know our product is unique and compelling, and we know there will be some users very excited by it. We'd like to pay them to spread the word. We may work on an affiliate program.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Generating Publicity</b>: We have a few ideas on how to create some buzz. For example, we can hold the world's largest Penny Auction, or create a zero-fee Penny Auction with some very fast-paced parameters (eg: each bid is free, and only adds 2 blocks).
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Building Loyalty</b>: We can increase player loyalty by rewarding those who most frequent the site. For example, we may work on a loyalty system.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Tapping Into the PennyEther Community</b>: We know we haven't thought of everything. We'll be in close contact with fellow Token Holders on <a href="reddit.com/r/PennyEther/" target="_blank">/r/PennyEther</a> in search of great marketing and product ideas.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Giving Back to Ethereum</b>: We've created a lot of very useful UI and Testing tools that we'd like to package and spread amongst Ethereum developers. While it may not directly benefit us, we believe having a good standing amongst developers could help

						<h3>Design Goals</h3>
						<p>
							PennyEther was designed with these goals:
							<ul>
								<li>Profits can be continuously distributed to Token Holders, at any time.</li>
								<li>PennyEther runs autonomously.</li>
								<li>Games can easily be added or upgraded.</li>
							</ul>

									</div>
								</p>
								<p>
									We've created an ERC20-compliant Token Contract that can dispurse dividends <b>at any time.</b> Any Ether sent to this contract is credited to all Token Holders, proportional to their ownership at the time the dividend is issued. We hope this type of Token becomes the norm.
								</p>
								<p>
									We've also created <a href="/uis/tokenholder.html" target="_blank">the Token UI</a> to help Token Holders view and/or claim their dividends, as well as transfer, set approval amounts, and view history.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some key points:
									<ul>
										<li>Token Holders can claim dividends whenever they want, either manually or through <a href="/uis/tokenholder.html" target="_blank">the UI</a>.</li>
										<li>When tokens are transferred from one account to another, the dividends <u>are not</u> also transferred. They will remain claimable by the original account.</li>
										<li>Tokens will never be frozen; they can always be transferred.</li>
										<li>There are no "distribution periods", and dividends are never forfeited.</li>
										<li>Dividends are distributed in an amortized fashion, preventing any type of gas attack on the contract. Credit goes to Nick Johnson for the idea in <a href="https://medium.com/@weka/dividend-bearing-tokens-on-ethereum-42d01c710657" target="_blank">this article</a>.</li>

								</p>
								<h3>The Contract</h3>
								<p>
									At the heart of PennyEther is the <a href="/about/contracts.html#treasury" target="_blank">Treasury contract</a>. This contract holds all the Ether of PennyEther in two separate accounts: "Capital" and "Profits". The Treasury has strict behavior about when Ether can leave either of those two accounts.
								</p>
								<p>
									We've created a <a href="/status/treasury.html" target="_blank">UI for the Treasury</a>. You can see the full financial health of the Treasury, including cash-flow, past dividends, etc.
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="capital"></a>
								<h3>Profits & Dividends</h3>
								<p>
									The Treasury contains a balance called "profits". Any Ether that is sent to the Treasury's fallback function is added to this balance. Profits can <u>only</u> leave the Treasury to be sent to the <a href="#token">PENNY Token</a>, which is hard-coded. In this manner we are assured that all profits sent to the Treasury get distributed to Token Holders.
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="capital"></a>
								<h3>Capital</h3>
								<p>
									Capital is Ether that the Treasury uses to bankroll Game Controllers. The flow of capital is described below:
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Capital <u>only</u> enters the Treasury:</b>
									<ol>
										<li>At the end of CrowdSale, the <a href="#comptroller">Comptroller</a> will pass in a portion of the raised Ether as Capital.</li>
										<li>The Treasury can <i>recall</i> Capital from any contract that it has Bankrolled, provided that contract has a sufficient balance.</li>
										<li>In the unlikely event that the Treasury <a href="#additional-funding">increases its Capital Target</a>, the Comptroller will sell Tokens until the required Capital has been raised.</li>
										<li>Capital can be donated by anyone.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Capital <u>only</u> leaves the Treasury:</b>
									<ol>
										<li>To fund a <span class="code">Bankrollable</span> contract (eg, InstaDice, VideoPoker, or Monarch) which has specified the Treasury as the profit recipient.</li>
										<li>In the unlikely event that there is excess Capital, it can be transferred to Profits and distributed to Token Holders.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="governance"></a>
								<h3>Governance</h3>
								<p>
									The follow events require a <span class="code">Governance Request</span> to be executed:
									<ol>
										<li>Sending Capital to a <span class="code">Bankrollable</span> contract. This occurs if the Admin (or DAO) decides a game could use more bankroll.</li>
										<li>Recalling Capital from a <span class="code">Bankrollable</span> contract. This occurs if the Admin (or DAO) decides a game no longer needs bankroll.</li>
										<li>Raising the Capital Target. This occurs if the Admin (or DAO) decides more capital is needed. <i>This dilutes all Token Holders, owners included.</i> As such, this would only ever occur if Capital could be used to generate a return.</li>
										<li>Distributing excess Capital to Profits.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>
									A <span class="code">Governance Request</span> is a request that is created by the <a href="#admin">Admin</a> (eventually the <a href="#dao">DAO</a>) that specifies execution parameters and a reason why. Once created, the request will remain pending for one week before it is able to be executed. During this one week period, it can be cancelled by the Admin (or DAO).
								</p>
								<p>
									There are several reason for Governance Requests:
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Transparency:</b> All Token Holders can see where Capital is going, and for what reason, a week ahead of time. Should they suspect abuse or see a problem, it can be brought to the attention of everyone.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Security:</b> Should the Admin account become compromised, there is a one week period to restore the Admin account to a trusted account. Treasury Capital will be at risk only if no action is taken after a week.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Future DAO'ification:</b> In the future it will be possible to put Token Holders in charge by setting the Admin account to a DAO contract. This means Token Holders will essentially control PennyEther's Capital.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Note: All past and present <a href="/status/treasury.html" target="_blank">Governance Requests can be viewed here.</a>
								</p>

								<h3>Situations</h3>
								<p>
									The below table lists all situations, and how the Treasury can react to them via Governance:

										Everything about this contract is hard coded; its behavior cannot be changed. There are no "emergency backdoors." It has been <a href="/about/contracts.html#comptroller" target="_blank">thoroughly tested</a> and is undergoing audit.
									</div>
								</p>
								<p>
									The Comptroller runs the CrowdSale, and is the only contract that can do the following:
									<ul>
										<li>Mint PENNY Tokens</li>
										<li>Start vesting Owner tokens</li>
										<li>Send Capital to Treasury as Raised Capital</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="comptroller-crowdsale"></a>
								<h3>CrowdSale</h3>
								<p>
									The Comptroller can run a one-time CrowdSale. The following parameters can be set and edited by the <a href="#owner-wallet">PennyEther Team</a>, until the CrowdSale begins:
									<ul>
										<li>
											<span class="code"><b>Start Date</b></span>: The earliest date at which Ether can be converted to Tokens in the CrowdSale.</li>
										<li>
											<span class="code"><b>End Date</b></span>: The latest date at which Ether can be converted to Tokens in the CrowdSale.</li>
										<li>
											<span class="code"><b>Soft Cap</b></span>: The amount of Ether raised after which the CrowdSale will be considered "successful". If this value is <i>not</i> met, all investments are refunded, and issued Tokens will remain frozen.</li>
										<li>
											<span class="code"><b>Hard Cap</b></span>: The maximum amount of Ether the CrowdSale will raise.</li>
										<li>
											<span class="code"><b>Bonus Cap</b></span>: The value of Ether raised after which there is no bonus.</li>
										<li>
											<span class="code"><b>Capital Pct</b></span>: The percentage of Ether raised that will be sent to the Treasury as Capital, to bankroll games.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									The CrowdSale raises up to <span class="code">Hard Cap</span> Ether and issues PENNY Tokens in return. These tokens will remain frozen until the CrowdSale ends. The CrowdSale ends when the date surpasses <span class="code">End Date</span> or the amount of Ether raised meets <span class="code">Hard Cap</span>.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>If <span class="code">SoftCap</span> is Met:</b>
									<ul>
										<li>
											All tokens will be unfrozen (transferrable).
										</li>
										<li>
											The <a href="#token-locker"><span class="code">Token Locker</span></a> will be issued 20% of Tokens; these Tokens will gradually become available to the <a href="#owner-wallet">PennyEther Team</a> over a 600 day period.
										</li>
										<li>
											<span class="code">Capital Pct</span>% of the Ether raised will be sent to <a href="#treasury">Treasury</a> as Capital Raised, and will be able to be used to bankroll games.
										</li>
										<li>
											The remaining Ether will be sent to the <a href="#owner-wallet">PennyEther Team</a> to be used to fund development, marketing, advertising, and as compensation for selling 80% of all future profits.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>If <span class="code">SoftCap</span> is Not Met:</b>
									<ul>
										<li>
											All tokens will remain frozen (untransferrable).
										</li>
										<li>
											The <a href="#owner-wallet">PennyEther Team</a> will be issued hundreds of billions of tokens, effectively setting its ownership to 100%.
										</li>
										<li>
											All Ether received will be refundable, forever.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="additional-funding"></a>
								<h3>Additional Funding</h3>
								<p>
									The Comptroller is also able to sell Tokens in one more circumstance: If, <a href="#governance">via Governance</a>, the Treasury requests more Capital. <b>Without this feature, the amount of Capital available to Treasury would be forever limited to the amount raised in the CrowdSale.</b> This feature allows for more Capital to be raised in a manner that is fair to all Token Holders -- everyone, including the PennyEther Team, is diluted. As such, additional Capital will only be raised if there is a high likelihood of seeing returns from it.
								</p>
								<p>
									While it's technically possible for the Comptroller to issue an unlimited amount of Tokens, there are three protections in place:
									<ol>
										<li>
											The Treasury can only trigger a RaiseCapitalRequest via <a href="#governance">Governance</a>. Once the DAO is implemented, then a RaiseCapitalRequest would only ever occur if there is a consensus among Token Holders.
										</li>
										<li>
											All Token Holders are diluted, <i>the PennyEther Team included</i>. There is no incentive for the PennyEther Team to dilute their ownership share unless they believe the raised Capital will result in higher profits.
										</li>
										<li>
											Capital can only be used to Bankroll games. The owners cannot simply keep the Ether that is raised -- it goes directly to the Treasury and is controlled via governance. Any pilfering would be immediately clear and would have a detrimental effect to value of the PennyEther Team's 20% ownership.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="token-locker"></a>
								<h3>Token Vesting</h3>
								<p>
									<div class="note">
										Everything about this contract is hard coded; its behavior cannot be changed. There are no "emergency backdoors." It has been <a href="/about/contracts.html#dividend-token-locker" target="_blank">thoroughly tested</a> and is undergoing audit.
									</div>
								</p>
								<p>
									The TokenLocker holds the <a href="#owner-wallet">PennyEther Team</a>'s 20% of ICO tokens. The Tokens vest at a rate of 1/6% per day (~5% per month) for a total of 600 days. The TokenLocker ensures tokens cannot be transferred until they are vested.
									<br><br>
									The dividends of the tokens are fully collectable by the PennyEther team. This ensures the PennyEther team is aligned with all other Token Holders; to have PennyEther produce more profits.
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="owner-wallet"></a>
								<h3>Owner Wallet</h3>
								<p>
									<div class="note">

								</p>
								<p>
									The PennyEther Team controls the Owner Wallet. This is a special contract that has permissions to do the following:

										<li>Add/remove contract mappings in <a href="#registry">the Registry</a></li>
										<li>Control vested Tokens that are in the <a href="#token-locker">Token Locker</a></li>

										<li>Set the parameters of the <a href="#comptroller-crowdsale">CrowdSale</a> (until it begins)</li>
										<li>Specify which account is the <a href="#admin">Admin</a> account.</li>

						<a data-anchor="the-dao"></a>
						<div class="page-subsection">
							<div class="head">The DAO</div>
							<div class="body">
								<p>
									Part of <a href="#pennyether-mission">PennyEther's mission</a> is to be run entirely by Token Holders. We view this goal as the ultimate pinnacle of PennyEther: the ability to an entirely self-running organization, distributing profits and managing capital, with no true owner. We're very much looking forward to implementing this.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the initial launch, the PennyEther Team will play <a href="#roles">the roles</a> of <span class="code">Admin</span>, <span class="code">Custodian</span>, <span class="code">Supervisor</span>, and <span class="code">Owner</span>. However, to grant Token Holders full control, a DAO will be created that will be permenantly be granted all of these roles, allowing Token Holders to control the entire system by creating and passing propositions.
								</p>

								<h3>Migration to DAO</h3>
								<p>
									Technically, the migration to a DAO is doable, and only involves altering a few <a href="#roles">roles</a>: <span class="code">Admin</span>, <span class="code">Custodian</span>, <span class="code">Supervisor</span>, and <span class="code">Owner</span>. It would work as follows:
									<ol>
										<li>
											The PennyEther Team, via the <span class="code">Custodian</span> account, would set the DAO as the <span class="code">Admin</span>. This would allow the DAO to make changes to game configurations, and control Capital via Governance. <i>However, the PennyEther Team could still change the <span class="code">Admin</span> at any time, via the <span class="code">Custodian</span> account.</i>
										</li>
										<li>
											The PennyEther Team, via the <span class="code">Supervisor</span> account, would set the DAO as the <span class="code">Custodian</span>. This would allow the DAO to control the Registry, meaning it could add, remove, and upgrade games. <i>However, the PennyEther Team could still change the <span class="code">Custodian</span> via the <span class="code">Supervisor</span> account.</i>
										</li>
										<li>
											The PennyEther Team, via the <span class="code">Owner</span> account, would set the DAO as the <span class="code">Supervisor</span>. This would allow the DAO to upgrade itself. <i>However, the PennyEther Team could still change the <span class="code">Supervisor</span> account via the <span class="code">Owner</span> account.</i>
										</li>
										<li>
											Lastly, the PennyEther team, via the <span class="code">Owner</span> account, would set the <span class="code">Owner</span> account to <span class="code">0x0</span>. This would permenantly set the DAO in control of PennyEther.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<h3>Problems</h3>
								<p>
									While a full DAO is our ambition, there are some problems that can arise on the path towards a DAO. 
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Properly configuring voting mechanisms</b>: The DAO must be set up to anticipate a low rate of participation, but at the same time must prevent a large Token Holder (for example, the PennyEther Team) from becoming a dictator.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Emergency Management</b>: If the <span class="code">Owner</span> account is set to <span class="code">0x0</span>, there is no turning back. If there's a bug in the DAO, PennyEther could become irreparable. It is likely that instead of setting <span class="code">Owner</span> to <span class="code">0x0</span>, <span class="code">Owner</span> would be set to some sort of emergency contract -- the details of which need to be fully fleshed out.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Maintaining Owner Rights</b>: If the above role transitions are executed, the DAO will own the <a href="#token-locker">Token Locker</a>, which is supposed to be accessible strictly to the PennyEther Team. This means the PennyEther Team would have to create a proposition to collect their dividends, and, likewise, vested tokens. While this is an interesting check and balance, it seems a bit severe. The DAO will likely need to contain code that allows the PennyEther Team to still access TokenLocker directly.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Regardless, we are tremendously excited to work with our Token Holders in creating the world's first 100% decentralized organization. We have the all of the pieces in place, and are optimistic that there are no technical limitataions -- only social ones.

							<div class="head">The UI</div>
							<div class="body">
								<h3>Design Goals</h3>
								<p>
									Part of the motivation behind creating PennyEther was the disappointment we experienced when using other dApps. They simply did not offer a user experience respectful of the transferring of cryptocurrency. We saw very little, if any: status indicators, transaction summaries, loading bars, gas price choosers, history viewers, etc. We were also frustrated by the ease of which transactions could be generated that would fail and consume all gas. <b>We knew we could do better, and we think we have.</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									Our UI follows a few guiding principals, and we believe it results in a product strides above the rest:
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Transactions are sacred</b>: Transactions are the core of interaction between the User and Our Contracts. Upon starting a transaction, the user should be able to intelligently select a Gas Price, and view the full call details (method name, parameter values, etc). During a transaction the user should receive full details about the transaction (etherscan link, estimated time left). After the transaction, the user should see a user-friendly summary that includes everything that changed as a result of the transaction.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Keep Good Records</b>: Show all of a user's history in one place, in a way that makes sense. Show a run down of every game the user took with your system. This allows the user to link to a game or interaction that they have a question about, and also assures them that PennyEther has nothing to hide.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Information is Everything</b>: Part of the value of Smart Contracts is transparency. As much information about contracts should be made as public as possible, and easily understandable to the user. Show all the relevant contract state variables, and what they mean.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Respect Gas</b>: Optimize contracts. Don't fail on errors, but instead log error events and display them to the user.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								
								<h3>Security</h3>
								<p>
									One interesting aspect to the <a href="#monarchy">Monarchy Game</a> is that there exists a strong incentive to try to DDoS the PennyEther website. By doing so, an attacker would eliminate any opponents relying on the website to interact with the contract. To counter this attack, we've made the UI open-sourced, and easily run on any computer. We're also using CloudFlare to thwart any DDoS attempts.
								</p>
								<p>
									Additionally, <b>the UI serves everything locally</b>, and does not do any external requests at all. <b>This means the UI is 100% cacheable</b>, and should a DDoS occur, CloudFlare will serve a cached version which will entirely work. This also means that any malicious changes to third party JavaScript libraries used (which is already quite limited) will not effect us.
								</p>

								<h3>Tools and Extensibility</h3>
								<p>
									We've created some very useful UI Tools that make it a lot easier to develop web3 webpages, and will speed up the process of creating new game UIs. We will likely open source these tools in the hopes of gaining exposure and reputation. For more information, view our <a href="https://github.com/pennyether/ui" target="_blank">UI Github</a>.
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>EthUtil</b> and <b>EthStatus</b>: Tells the UI if the user has web3 enabled, what their account is, which network they're on, when there's a new block, etc. Shows a record of their recent transactions, include annotated method names and parameters, and the gas used and events triggered.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>NiceWeb3</b>: An internal web3-compatible wrapper that prevents passing arguments incorrectly, promisifies all transaction calls, makes getting events easier, and is compatible with MetaMask. Makes developer's lives <i>a lot</i> easier than standard web3.js.
										</li>
										<li>
											UI Components: We've created some reusable UI components that are applicable to any new game added (and, realistically, any dApp).
											<ul>
												<li>
													<b>GasPriceSlider</b>: Pulls realtime gas price data from <a href="ethgasstation.info" target="_blank">Eth Gas Station</a> and shows a slider so that the user can easily select a gas price.
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>TxStatus</b>: Shows a loading bar that approximates how long a transaction will take, shows a link to the pending or completed transaction, and shows the end result of the transaction with all relevant details.
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>EthGraph</b>: Used on status pages to show the change of a contract's particular value over time.  Loads data points in a performant manner and allows for arbitrary zooming and scrolling. Extremely useful and easy to use.
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>EthGraph</b>: Used on status pages to show the change of a contract's particular value over time.  Loads data points in a performant manner and allows for arbitrary zooming and scrolling. Extremel useful.

								<h3>Roles & Scenarios</h3>
								<div class="body">
								<p>
									<a data-anchor="roles"></a>
									There are a few roles that participate in and manage PennyEther:
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b><span class='code'>Anybody</span></b>: Can participate in games, and can run <a href="#task-manager"><span class='code'>Tasks</span></a> for rewards.
											<ul>
												<li>
													<span class='code'>Anybody</span> can, at worst, play PennyEther games with the intent of bankrupting the house. We say, have at it!
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<a data-anchor="admin"></a>
										<li>
											<b><span class='code'>Admin</span></b>: Can alter minor configurations in the system, within strict limits. For example, <span class='code'>Admin</span> can change <span class='code'>Task</span> reward amounts, and can change <span class='code'>Monarchy</span>, <span class="code">InstaDice</span>, and <span class="code">InstaDice</span> game parameters.
											<ul>
												<li>
													The <span class='code'>Admin</span> can, at worst, cause <span class='code'>Tasks</span> to pay high rewards (limited to <span class='code'>Daily Funding Limit</span>). The Admin can also create <a href="#governance">governance requests</a>, but must wait one week before executing them.
												</li>
												<li>
													All changes are reversible by <span class='code'>Custodian</span>, <span class='code'>Supervisor</span>, and <span class='code'>Owner</span>. Governance Requests can be cancelled within one week. 
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b><span class='code'>Custodian</span></b>: Acts on behalf of the <a href="#owner-wallet">Owner Wallet</a>, can change the <span class='code'>Admin</span> account, and can add, remove, or upgrade non-core contracts (<span class='code'>TaskManager</span>, and all game controllers).
											<ul>
												<li>
													The <span class='code'>Custodian</span> can, at worst, cause all revenues to cease.
												</li>
												<li>
													All changes are reversible by <span class='code'>Supervisor</span>, and <span class='code'>Owner</span>.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b><span class='code'>Supervisor</span></b>: A cold wallet that can change who the <span class='code'>Custodian</span> is, should they no longer be trust-worthy.
											<ul>
												<li>
													The <span class='code'>Supervisor</span> can, at worst, cause all revenues to cease. This account also can also collect the <a href="token-locker">Token Locker's</a> accrued dividends.
												</li>
												<li>
													All changes are reversible by <span class='code'>Owner</span>. The collection of dividends cannot be reversed.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b><span class='code'>Owner</span></b>: A very cold wallet, ideally never used, that can change who the <span class='code'>Supervisor</span> is.
											<ul>
												<li>
													The <span class='code'>Owner</span> can cause PennyEther to effectively be terminated. <b>This account will ideally never be used.</b>
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>Prior to the DAO being instated, this account can control everything</b>.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b><a href="#the-dao"><span class='code'>The DAO</span></a></b>: Once instated, will take the roles of any or all: <span class="code">Admin</span>, <span class="code">Custodian</span>, <span class="code">Supervisor</span>, and <span class="code">Owner</span>.
											<ul>
												<li>
													The DAO will allow PennyEther to be run in a fully autonomonized and democratic fashion. If instated fully, the DAO will replace the PennyEther Team in running PennyEther.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="owner-alignment"></a>
								<h3>Alignment of Goals</h3>
								<p>
									Prior to the instatement of <a href="#the-dao">the DAO</a>, the PennyEther Team will have full control over PennyEther. However, there is no incentive to act maliciously, as the team's goals are purely aligned with Token Holders. For more information, see: <a href="#owner-alignment">owner alignment</a>.
								</p>

								<h3>Tests and Audits</h3>
								<div class="note" style="text-align: center;">
									<a href="/about/contracts.html">All information about our contracts can be found here.</a>
								</div>
								<p>
									We've done our best to ensure our contracts do what they are intended to. In additional to performing the most <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pennyether/contracts/blob/master/tests/results/index.html" target="_blank">exhaustive tests</a> we've see done on contracts, we've painstakingly described and commented our contracts. Lastly, all of our contracts will undergo audit from at least one reputable third party.
								</p>
								<p>
									

								<a data-anchor="autonomy"></a>
								<h3>Autonomy</h3>
								<p>
									Part of <a href="/#pennyether-mission">our mission</a> is to create a blockchain application that is as autonomous as possible. To us, that means that the application can be entirely run strictly by Token Holders in some sort of democratic fashion. It also means that there should be no case where the application relies on the owners or admins to take actions or execute functions.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b><a href="#task-manager">TaskManager</a> ensures required tasks are continuous performed.</b>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b><a href="#the-dao">The DAO</a> will fully decentralize PennyEther.</b>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								
								<a href="#task-manager"></a>
								<h3>Task Manager</h3>
								<p>
									The Task Manager ensures autonomy by rewarding users for executing tasks necessary to keep PennyEther running. Users are rewarded because it costs Gas to execute these tasks, and also so that tasks are executed in a timely manner. An example Task is telling the Treasury to issue a Dividend, or telling a Game Controller to send its profits to the Treasury.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are times when certain functions need to be called to keep PennyEther running as expected. Some examples are:
									<ul>
										<li>
											When the <span class="code">Treasury</span> has a large enough balance to pay dividends, a function must be called that causes it to send profits to the <span class="code">Token</span>. Otherwise, dividends are never issued.
										</li>
										<li>
											When a Penny Auction completes, another one should be started in its place. Otherwise, no new auctions are created, and no revenue is generated.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									To pretty much guarantee that both of the above functions are called, we've financially incentivized the functions through what we call <span class="code">Tasks</span>:
									<ul>
										<li>
											Any contract function that keeps PennyEther running, or distributes prizes, revenues, or dividends should be callable by <span class="code">Anyone</span>
										</li>
										<li>
											Moreover, since these functions require gas to execute, and provide value to PennyEther, users should be <i>rewarded</i> for calling them.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Since <span class="code">Tasks</span> receive a financial reward, and are callable by anyone, PennyEther should keep running (as long as people want free Ether). This type of design is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive-centered_design" target="_blank">Incentive-centered Design</a>. To make sure everyone is aware of these <span class="code">Tasks</span>, we've created <a href="/games/tasks.html" target="_blank">a UI that shows all available <span class="code">Tasks</span> in detail</a>.

								<p>
									Our architecture makes it easy to add new games:
									<ol>
										<li>
											<b>Code the Contract</b>: Coding the contract in Solidity is a fairly simple process, once you're used to Solidity. InstaDice took only a few days of coding, for example.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Test the Contract</b>: We've created a <a href="#testing-framework">testing framework</a> that makes writing very thorough tests quite easy.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Upgrade <a href="#task-manager"><span class='code'>TaskManager</span></a></b>: If the new game requires any <span class='code'>Tasks</span> to be run to keep it autonomous, this logic should be added to <span class='code'>MainController</span>.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Create UI</b>: This is perhaps the most time consuming process. We've created some <a href="#application-ui-tools">UI Tools</a> to make this a lot easier.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Create Status Page</b>: The game should have a page that shows it's current status, past games played, etc.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Deploy and Bankroll</b>: Deploying the game is as simple as adding an entry to the <a href="#registry">Registry</a>, and creating a <a href="#governance">Governance Request</a> to bankroll it.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="testing-framework"></a>
								<h3>Testing Framework</h3>
								<p>
									Testing smart contracts is hard. We've developed a testing framework that makes it easier for developers to write exhaustive tests, and that produces very helpeful human-readable results.  As a result, we believe our dApp contains the most thorough testing of any dApp release.
									<ul>
										<li>Example: <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pennyether/contracts/blob/master/tests/results/DividendToken.js.html" target="_blank">test results for PENNY Token</a></li>
										<li>Example: <a href="https://github.com/pennyether/contracts/blob/master/tests/DividendToken.test.js" target="_blank">test file for PENNY Token</a></li>
										<li>More details on GitHub</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<a data-anchor="registry"></a>
								<h3>The Registry Contract</h3>
								<p>
									The <span class='code'>CrowdSale</span>, <span class='code'>Treasury</span>, <span class='code'>Token</span>, and <span class='code'>TokenLocker</span> are all hard-coded, and cannot be altered or redeployed. <i>All other contracts can easily be upgraded or added via the <span class="code">Registry</span></i>. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This contract contains <span class="code">name=>address</span> mappings. Upgrading a contract is as simple as deploying the new version, and changing the mapping to point to the new address. All existing contracts will immediately start using the new mapping. This architecture ensures that contracts can be upgraded, and new contracts can be deployed very easily.
								</p>
								<p>
									For example, adding a new game is simple. We would add a mapping for it in the Registry, and upgrade <span class="code">MainController</span> to interact with this contract.
								</p>
								<p>
									Using a <span class="code">Registry</span> is also simpler than other methods. There are no delegate calls, and there's no need to manage contract memory indexes. This comes at a cost -- it's more difficult to migrate existing contact data. To alleviate this concern, all upgradable contracts contain little to no state, and their state is superficial in that it does not effect the core operation of PennyEther.
								</p>

								<h3>Open Sourced</h3>
								<p>
									Both our contracts and our UI have been open sourced. This allows us to leverage an entire world of developers to improve our product:
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Bounties:</b> We can easily offer bounties for various improvements, no matter how large or small. For example, we could post a bounty for adding graphs of dividends to the Token UI, or for decreasing the gas cost of some transactions.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Easy to develop:</b> Both of our projects are extremely simple to get up and running for any developer. The UI requires no external dependancies, and the contracts UI has a suite of tests that must be passed.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Quality:</b> As with any open-source project, we feel by involving more developers and stakeholders, the overall quality of PennyEther will be improved. As owners, ultimately the PennyEther Team will oversee all merges to ensure they meet quality and security standards.
										</li>
									</ul>

								<li>There is no "registration period", "pre-sale", or "phases".</li>
								<li>Between 78% and 69% of Ether raised is used as Treasury bankroll, redeemable by Token Holders.</li>

								<li>If an error occurs when buying tokens (eg, sale not started or sale already completed), minimal gas is used and Ether is refunded.</li>
								<li>If the Soft Cap is not met, all investors can claim a full refund.</li>
								<li>The bonus is on a linear scale, starting at 50%, and smoothly tapering down to 0%.</li>

								<p>
									We chose our Soft Cap and Hard Cap based on three factors:
									<ol>
										<li>
											<b>Our Structure</b>: Our CrowdSale is not typical. <b>Between 78% and 69% of Ether raised will end up in the Treasury as bankroll</b>, owned by all Token Holders, and redeemable at any time. Only the remaining 22% to 31% of Ether raised will be used as capital to fund development, marketing, advertising, and everything else.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Revenue Potential</b>: We feel we're in a position to capitalize on blockchain dice via <a href="#games-instadice">InstaDice</a>, and that <a href="#monarchy">Penny Auctions</a> will prove to be a very successful blockchain game. Because we're effectively selling the rights to 80% of profits, we want to be sure we're adequately compensated.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Our Competition</b>: We ask you to judge us against what our competition has produced (or even has promised to produce), how they are structured, and what they're currently valued at.
										</li>
									</ol>

								<h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
								<p>
									We tried our best to use our competitor's products, but honestly found it quite difficult and time consuming to actually place a bet. Not a single game <a href="#game-standards">met our standards</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									We also tried to gather information on Token Rights, such as profit distribution, dividend periods, etc. We found it rather difficult to get any concrete answers. As always, we suggest you do your own research. If you believe any of this table needs correction, please <a href="/about/contact.html" target="_blank">contact us</a>.
