						We're tremendously excited to announce that PennyEther is <a href="https://www.pennyether.com">live on MainNet</a> and taking bets! You can <a href="https://www.pennyether.com/about/all-contracts.html">view the details of all deployed contracts</a> (source code, tests, etherscan verification, etc), as well as the <a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/status/overview.html">realtime status of all contracts</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We've launched with three games:
						<ul class="spaced">
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.pennyether.com/games/monarchy.html">Monarchy</a>: The world's first truly-fair king-of-the-hill game. Overthrow the current Monarch, and if you reign for long enough without getting overthrown, you'll win the prize! For the first time in a history, a provably fair king-of-the-hill game!
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.pennyether.com/games/instadice.html">InstaDice</a>:  Choose your own odds. Instant results. The world's fastest purely blockchain dice game. No oracles and no third parties means 100% fairness, and insanely cheap transactions. Choose your desired payout odds, roll, see your results as soon as your transaction is mined -- about 20 seconds. Just 1% house odds!
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.pennyether.com/games/videopoker.html">Video Poker</a>: 9/6 Video Poker on the blockchain. The world's only purely blockchain video poker. A typical hand takes less than minute to play, and you can play multiple hands at once. Our 9/6 paytable yields an impressive 99.54% payback if played optimally.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						We're starting off with rather low maximum bets, but those will increase after all audits are complete, and after the CrowdSale, which is to be announced soon.
					</p>

					<h3>Breaking new ground</h3>
					<p>
						After nearly a year long journey of planning and development, we're proud to break new ground in the blockchain ecosystem: 
						<ul class="spaced linky">
							<li>
								<a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/ico/whitepaper.html#monarchy">The world's first provably-fair Penny Auction game</a>, called Monarchy. It's a king-of-the-hill game made possible by distributing the profits to Token Holders. This means nobody can cheat -- the PennyEther Team cannot play for free, since all fees get sent to Token Holders.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/ico/whitepaper.html#instadice">Ethereum's first Instant Dice game</a> -- see results the moment your transaction is mined, and at the lowest gas price of all Ethereum dice games.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/ico/whitepaper.html#videopoker">The world's first purely blockchain Video Poker</a>, with a UI that allows for easily playing on multiple machines.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/ico/whitepaper.html#security-autonomy">A Token that actually represents ownership</a>: all profits of PennyEther will be distributed via our Realtime Dividend Token. Eventually Token Holders will run <i>everything</i> via a DAO contract that can create and execute propositions.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pennyether/contracts/blob/master/tests/results/index.html">The most extensive smart contract tests that we've seen</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/status/overview.html">Full transparency of every contract via our realtime status pages</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/ico/whitepaper.html#the-ui">An open-sourced UI focused on experience, and not hype</a>. Our UI allows players to intelligently choose gas prices, see transaction progress and details, and view their full transaction history. Our UI is open source and easily runnable -- if for any reason our domain goes down, players can run the UI locally.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/ico/whitepaper.html#task-manager">A Task Manager system</a> that uses incentive-based design to ensure PennyEther runs autonomously.
							</li>
							<li>
								PennyEther will soon become the <a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/ico/whitepaper.html#the-dao"><b>a <i>true</i> DAO</b></a>, where the Token Holders are the only owners.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>The Deployment</h3>
					<p>
						After deploying to all three test networks (Ropsten, Kovan, and Rinkeby) and doing some testing, we decided to go live. If you'd like to play games on any test site, simply switch your provider to the test net of your choice. PennyEther should automatically reload and indicate which network you are on.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, our MainNet games are bankrolled manually by the PennyEther Team's own Ether , and not via the Treasury (since there is 0 Capital). <u>All profits will go to the Treasury and will remain stuck there until the CrowdSale is completed</u>.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the CrowdSale, profits will be able to be sent to the PENNY Token as dividends, and we'll use the raised Capital to bankroll our games so they're able to offer increased maximum bets.
					</p>

					<h3>What's Next?</h3>
					<p>
						Despite the amount of hard work we've put into the project already, we realize this is just the beginning of our journey towards building a profitable, truly autonomous organization -- with no central owner or authority. <a href="https://investor.pennyether.com/ico/whitepaper.html#roadmap">View our roadmap</a> for more details on our longterm vision.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the near term:
						<ul class="spaced">
							<li>
								We'll be engaging with the community via Reddit and Discord.
							</li>
							<li>
								We'll shortly be announcing a bug bounty program, and are actively seeking auditors.
							</li>
							<li>
								We'll be launching some promotional Monarchy games with big prizes and small fees.
							</li>
							<li>
								We'll be finalizing our CrowdSale terms shortly.
							</li>
						</ul>
