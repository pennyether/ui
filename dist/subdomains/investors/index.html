						<b>PennyEther is an experiment</b>. What started as a little Ethereum side-project has grown into a full-time devotion to creating a fair, autonomous, revenue-generating blockchain application. It's our way of pushing the limits of Ethereum, and economics, to see just how feasible the dream of a "pure" DAO is. We'd be thrilled for you to join us for the ride.
					</p>

						We've done our best to make all information about PennyEther available. You may find the links below helpful:

						<div class="head">Our Goals</div>
						<div class="body">
							<p>
								We decided very early on that our focus was technology, and not marketing. Our team members are technical-minded, and we're all fatigued by the current ICO and crypto market -- it's endless hype, endless promises, and endless scandal. We want no part in that, though we <i>do</i> want to garner enough interest in our experiement to give it a shot at success.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are much more interested in building and earning revenue from a working product. Partly there's the dream of earning a sizeable passive income for ourselves and our Token Holders, but mostly there's a strong desire to create the most fully-fledged distributed application, ever. We've seen very few projects developed past a prototype or simulated screen-grab, and we want to break new ground.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>We decided early on to not go public until our product is ready.</b> After nearly a year of work, here we are. (Suggested reading: <a href="/about/investor-mission.html">Our Mission</a>)

						<div class="head">What PennyEther Is</div>
						<div class="body">
							<p>
								PennyEther is a blockchain application that autonomously earns revenue by running various smart contracts on the blockchain. All contracts send their profits to the Treasury, and the Treasury issues dividends by sending Ether to the PENNY Token. The PENNY Token distributes dividends to all Token Holders proportionally; Token Holders can collect their share at any time.
							</p>
							<p>
								It should be noted that this type of system has not been possible until now. With the advent of blockchain technology, and our PENNY Token (an ERC20 Token that distributes dividends), we're proud to present the first Token that provides <i>real</i> ownership, backed by all the benefits of blockchain and smart contract technology: <i>irrevocability</i>, <i>censorship-resistance</i>, <i>full autonomy</i>, and <i>full transparency</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								We're working to push this one step further. By creating a <a href="/about/contracts.html#dao">DAO contract</a>, we'll put our Token Holders in full control of the entire system. Adding new games to the system, allocating bankroll to them, and changing their settings will all be done by consensus of Token Holders and nobody else. <b>After the DAO is instated, PennyEther will be the world's first real DAO</b>.

						<div class="head">What PennyEther Isn't</div>
						<div class="body">
							<p>
								This is not a marketing project. We've delivered and explained everything as fully as we can -- what you see is what you get.
								<ul>
									<li>We're not going to try to pump our token value.</li>
									<li>We're not going to spend any money on marketing our token.</li>
									<li>We're not going to offer bounties for spamming our name around the ICO-sphere.</li>
									<li>Most importantly, <b>we're not going to make promises that we cannot deliver.</b></li>
								</ul>  
							</p>
							<p>
								We fully realize that we may be "missing out" by not building a hype-machine, but this is the path we've chosen. <b>It's ultimately your decision whether or not to join us.</b>
							</p>

					<div class="page-subsection">
						<div class="head">Why ICO?</div>
						<div class="body">
							<p>
								Firstly, <b>distributed ownership is our strength.</b> It allows us to hold the <b>world's first truly-fair Penny Auctions</b> (aka, <a href="/ico/whitepaper.html#monarchy">Monarchy</a>). This type of game format is known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pay_auction">all-pay auction</a>, and suffers the problem of "shilling", where an owner can effectively play for free. If ownership is distributed, this is no longer a problem. By having an ICO, for the first time in history, truly-fair all-pay auctions games can be run -- this includes king-of-the-hill games like <a href="/games/monarchy.html">Monarchy</a>, as well as lotteries, raffles, and more.
							</p>
							<p>
								Secondly, <b>an ICO means we will have bankroll</b>. Bankroll means we can take larger maximum bets. And larger maximum bets means our games like <a href="/games/instadice.html">InstaDice</a> and <a href="/games/videopoker.html">VideoPoker</a> will generate more profit. Even though we're selling 80% ownership, 20% of a larger pie is good enough for us.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thirdly, <b>there is strength in numbers</b>. We want to develop a community that foster creative game ideas, third party development, and more. There's only so much our own team can do, and if we give others a real stake in success, PennyEther has a much higher likelihood of thriving.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lastly, <b>we want to destroy our competition</b>. Having some Ether in the bank would help.
